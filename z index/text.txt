1. normal stacking orderis accroding to html order the last element will come in yhe first
2. when we give position property other then static(which is default property) to any element then it will come over other element
3. if we give position property to all the element then, again it will be determined by html
4. z index property can only be applied when we set postion property to an element
5. by default z index property has value auto which can be assumed equivalent to zero
6. the more position value of z index will move our element over the otther elements
7. when we have two container and if we set the index value on one of the child element of a container then that child element will come over another element
8. if we give position and z index value to two container then all element inside the container remain inside only it will only depend on the z index value of their parents.
