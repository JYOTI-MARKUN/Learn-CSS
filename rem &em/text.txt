when we set fotn-size in em then it will consider the parent font-size as 1em, and calculate font on this basis
when we set other height,width,margin,padding then it will check it's own font size as 1em and calculate properties based on that
when we set properties in rem then it will depend on the root/html element which is by default 16px , we can change that
