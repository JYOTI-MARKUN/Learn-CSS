css variable can be defined anywhere, 
if we have define css variable and use it then its easy as we need to change the property only in the section where we have defined them

css variable starts from -- and we can give them any name
once define css variable can be use anywhere in the code

we should always define css variable to the root element, although we can define them anywhere 

css varibel defined at root can be overright anywhere in the section as root element has very less specificity, if you want to overright css variable in some section 

fallback value if we do not have css variable available or we are facing some error to get them then we can use fallback value to that variable

 if we do not provide fallback value then it will inherit from its property
