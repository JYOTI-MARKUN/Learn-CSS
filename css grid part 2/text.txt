grid auto flow : by default it is row means no of row, if you create 10 grid item and give grid auto flow column then 10 column will be created
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4,100px);
    grid-auto-flow:column;  // when we have 10 columns and we set both these property then 4 column of 100 width will create and rest will take width automatically, but they can take different width 
    to avoid taking that the different width we can use grid-auto-columns 100px , then all rest columns will have width 100px by default its property is auto

if we wanna make height of all grid item same then we can use grid-auto-row 100px    

as we know from previous value when we set bxo 1 in third place using grid column start it pushes other element to avoid that we can use grid-auto-flow dense or row dense    


we can use all flex property in grid also , like align-item centre, justify-content etc
to make all grid item in the centre of their own grid content then use 
align-item centre justify-items centre  (their default property is normal or streached) (we can move our item within cell uisng these two properties)

property streached will streach the grid item to whole cell

use flex property to move items with grid cell, and to make one item to take whole cell width then use streach
we can also make one item within the centre of the cell using margin auto property 

we know that grid-column-start and grid column end we can set both of them using grid-column property

if we set any value in grid-column, grid-column-start, end and we do not have that row and column number than it will be created inmplicitly (automatically)

grid-template: shortcut fro grid-template-row and grid-template-column we have to set both properties to make it valid if you do not want to set one property then use none 

grid-template-column : repeat(4,auto ) // repreat (auto-fill,100px)  this fll craete auto column of 100xp according to available space
grid-template-columns: repeat(4,minmax(80px,100px)); min minimum aidth will be 80 and maximum will be 100px according to available space
